These exchanges have made it possible to create a common database of sleep records, to compare the analysis algorithms local to the various laboratories to each other by applying these algorithms to identical signals, and to set up a computer-aided interlaboratory evaluation of manual and automatic analysis methods.

But it hardly accommodates other investigations. EDF+ is a more flexible but still simple format which is compatible to \{EDF\} except that an EDF+ file may contain interrupted recordings. Also, EDF+ supports time-stamped annotations for the storage of events such as text annotations, stimuli, averaged signals, electrocardiogram parameters, apnoeas and so on. When compared to EDF, EDF+ can not only store annotations but also electromyography, evoked potentials, electroneurography, electrocardiography and many more types of investigations. Further improvements over \{EDF\} include the use of standard electrode names. EDF+ is so much like \{EDF\} that existing \{EDF\} viewers still display the signals in EDF+ files. Software development is limited mainly to implementing the annotations. EDF+ offers a format for a wide range of 
neurophysiological investigations which can become a standard within a few years. "

ABSTRACT={The INCF Program on Standards for Data Sharing has a working group that is developing a standard for storing electrophysiology data in HDF5. The impetus for this effort is that many experimentalists are starting to use HDF5 to store data, so a standard would facilitate data sharing significantly. <br /> <br />The most important requirement of such a standard is to accommodate the common types of data used in electrophysiology and also the metadata required to describe them. Neuroshare (an API for accessing electrophysiology data stored in various formats) defines four data types: analog signals, segments, neural events and experimental events; as well as some metadata. A standard needs to efficiently store these data types, and probably also imaging data and some kinds of data generated in the data processing chain, such as features used for spike sorting. <br /> <br />Further, a standard way of storing the metadata must be specified. The set of metadata required to describe electrophysiology data 
is difficult to determine <i>a priori</i> because the types of experiments are so varied.  So, a flexible mechanism must be used which allows referencing and specifying values for currently existing ontologies and also accommodates information not currently systematized. Techniques to include post-experiment annotations of data, and for relating different data parts, are also required. <br /> <br />There are numerous projects relevant to storing electrophysiology data in HDF5. These include: NEO, NeuroHDF, brainliner.jp, klusta-team spikedetekt, BrainVisionHDF5 and Ovation (ovation.io). A project, NeXus Format (nexusformat.org), uses HDF5 to store particle physics data, but might be adaptable for electrophysiology. It is managed using a well-defined community infrastructure that may be worth emulating. <br /> <br />So far, the working group entertains two approaches towards defining a standard, which may eventually be merged. One, currently named Pandora, defines a generic data model that can be used with 
HDF5 or other storage back-ends. Due to the generic nature, the data model can be used to store various kinds of neuroscience data. The other proposal, called epHDF, defines domain specific schemata for storing electrophysiology data in HDF5. For any approach, a suite of test data sets to help evaluate a proposed standard is needed, and tools to allow validating data files are desirable. <br /> <br />Details of the above considerations and the current state of the development of a standard will be presented.}}

We define a simple XML-based language, in which information on the structure of binary data files can be simply and efficiently coded. In most cases, description of an existing format takes relatively few lines of \{XML\} code. Once written, this information can be used by any software, which, owing to this meta-description, may read the original data files, thus eliminating the need for conversions and duplication of data. This proposition is hereby submitted to an open discussion within the community involved in relevant research, clinical and commercial applications. Links to the current version of the \{XML\} Schema defining the language and pilot implementation of a compliant viewer/annotator are located at http://eeg.pl/SignalML/. "

abstract="Metadata providing information about the stimulus, data acquisition, and experimental conditions are indispensable for the analysis and management of experimental data within a lab. However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the ``open metaData Markup Language'' (odML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In odML arbitrary metadata information is stored as extended key-value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to odML is a clear separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes odML flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in odML-
terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the odML format can be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of odML also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.",

	abstract = "Structured, efficient, and secure storage of experimental data and associated meta-information constitutes one of the most pressing technical challenges in modern neuroscience, and does so particularly in electrophysiology. The German INCF Node aims to provide open-source solutions for this domain that support the scientific data management and analysis workflow, and thus facilitate future data access and reproducible research. G-Node provides a data management system, accessible through an application interface, that is based on a combination of standardized data representation and flexible data annotation to account for the variety of experimental paradigms in electrophysiology. The G-Node Python Library exposes these services to the Python environment, enabling researchers to organize and access their experimental data using their familiar tools while gaining the advantages that a centralized storage entails. The library provides powerful query features, including data slicing and selection 
by metadata, as well as fine-grained permission control for collaboration and data sharing. Here we demonstrate key actions in working with experimental neuroscience data, such as building a metadata structure, organizing recorded data in datasets, annotating data, or selecting data regions of interest, that can be automated to large degree using the library. Compliant with existing de-facto standards, the G-Node Python Library is compatible with many Python tools in the field of neurophysiology and thus enables seamless integration of data organization into the scientific data workflow.",
